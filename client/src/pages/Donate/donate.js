                    Winning the lottery is a dream come true for millions yet only a few get to experience it. When the odds are clearly stacked, how can one increase the chances of winning? 
                    One way is to buy millions of tickets… but we would not be playing if we had millions of dollars would we? We wanted a way to increase the chances of winning the jackpot while keeping the cost low. 
                    Lotto Query was created to do just that. All of our wheels are 100% free to use.​
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    If our wheels proved useful and helped you win some money, please show your appreciation by donating to help keep the lights on.
